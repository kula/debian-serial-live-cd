# Debian Live CD with Serial Console

This repository in combination with the [Debian Live Project](https://live-team.pages.debian.net/live-manual/html/live-manual/index.en.html)
builds a Debian Live CD with a serial instead of PC console. 
It also includes some additional software for my needs.

It is based heavily on the [Live Images Repo](https://salsa.debian.org/live-team/live-images.git),
commit `3682a17e`.
